GoEuroTest Java Developer -- Solution By : Sharif Malik
============================
Note : Solution is solved using
i.	Spring Tool Suite,
ii.	Spring Framework especially Spring Dependency Injection
iii.Maven for building the project.
iv. Lombok for auto creation of setters, getters, constructors, and etc

This is a Java command line tool that takes a String as an input parameter, queries an API endpoint and transforms the result data into a CSV file.

```java -jar target/GoEuroTest.jar "CITY_NAME"```

The program takes this String "CITY_NAME" and queries it with the location JSON API endpoint:

http://api.goeuro.com/api/v2/position/suggest/en/CITY_NAME

Where CITY_NAME is a String that the user has entered as a parameter when calling the tool, e.g.

http://api.goeuro.com/api/v2/position/suggest/en/Mumbai

Building The Project
====================

The project compiles with ```JDK >= 1.6``` and ```Maven >= 3.1.1``` as the build tool and to also manage the project dependencies.

To run Maven build, execute the following from a console/command prompt with the project root directory as the top level directory:

```mvn clean package```

This will create a distributable and executable JAR file for the standalone application.

Then run the JAR file created by executing the following:

```java -jar target/GoEuroTest.jar Mumbai```

Results of the API query will be saved in a CSV file called: ```output.csv``` created at the root directory of the project.


### Instructions

-Spring Tool Suite / Eclipse users can import project by using the option of ,,Import Existing maven project" from the file system.

-To generate project documentation of Java source files (Javadoc), run `mvn javadoc:javadoc`
